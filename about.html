          <br>How to make them </h3>
        <h5>
          <ol>
            <li> In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short
              while before falling back into the mixture.</li><br>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix,
              which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li><br>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense
              toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more
              complex its flavor will be.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li><br>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4
              inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the
              cookies can spread evenly.</li><br>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li><br>
